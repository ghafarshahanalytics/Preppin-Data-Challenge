# Preppin-Data-Challenge
The overall aim of Preppin' Data is to give people a place to learn the power of being able to prepare your own data sets. These data preparation exercises are all available here: https://preppindata.blogspot.com/.

Using Python in Jupyter Notebook, I found these data preparation exercises incredibly valuable in improving my data analysis / research skills while learning new tips / tricks in the Python community.
